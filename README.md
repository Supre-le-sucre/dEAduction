# Something about the fork

This fork of dEAduction is essentially dedicated for improving lauching scripts.
You can see all unstable changes on the dev branch.

Please Note that windows is not the intended operating system for the application.
Therefore if you want to test out the running script of windows, please ensure the repo is on the C drive.
The reason for that is beacause this software is intended to work on a Unix based file manager, it is not able to work on drive based file manager like windows
